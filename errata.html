		<p>This is a list of errors identifed in the latest release of the protocol document which have not yet been integrated into an official release.

    <h3>v0.92 Beta errata</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>The cover page of the PDF is still titled version 0.91.</li>
      <li>Deposit Protocol, Section III, step 2.a: The recommended size of the test deposit ($6) might be too small for today's transaction fees. We recommend a deposit sufficient to fund 1000 bytes of transactions; as of January 17, 2018, with a fee rate of 510 sat/B and $11185 USD/BTC this is a deposit of approximately $57. Fees have since declined, but the user is advised to check the current fee rate before making the test deposit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>v0.91 Beta errata</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Deposit Protocol, Section III, step 2.a: The recommended size of the test deposit ($6) might be too small for today's transaction fees. We recommend a deposit sufficient to fund 1000 bytes of transactions; as of January 17, 2018, with a fee rate of 510 sat/B and $11185 USD/BTC this is a deposit of approximately $57.

      <li>Funding your Glacier cold-storage address from a segwit-enabled wallet (e.g. Electrum 3) may result in unspendable funds. (Your funds are safe; Glacier v0.92 Beta fixes this and enables your funds to be spent.) To avoid this problem:
	<ul>
	  <li>Create or recreate your App USBs using Glacier v0.92 Beta; or</li>
	  <li>Fund your Glacier address using a wallet that is not Segwit compatible; or</li>
	  <li>Send 100% of your wallet's funds to your Glacier address in a single transaction (so that no change output is created)</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
		  
	  <h3>v0.9 Beta errata</h3>
	  <ul>
	  	<li>Ubuntu 16.04.2 has been released, and the link to 16.04.1 in the protocol document has broken.  Use <a href="http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/xenial/ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso">http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/xenial/ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso</a> instead of <a href="http://releases.ubuntu.com/xenial/ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso">http://releases.ubuntu.com/xenial/ubuntu-16.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso</a>.</li>
		  <li>Windows: Setup Protocol step IV.5.b.i is missing a space in the terminal command after "sha256".
  		<li>Windows: Setup Protocol Section IV requires Windows Powershell, not a regular terminal/command line window
  		<li>Windows: Instructions for opening Windows Powershell were incorrect.  (Correct: Win-R, type "powershell", press Enter)
      <li>Some information (e.g. raw unspent transactions) are too long to be converted into a single QR code -- or the QR code may be such high resolution that some QR code readers may struggle to read it.  In these cases, you will need to split the data into multiple QR codes, and splice them back together after decoding the QR codes.  Be careful not to encode trailing spaces or newlines when splitting the data.
