description: Learn how to set up to withdrawal Bitcoin using Glacier, the
  step-by-step protocol for storing bitcoins in a highly secure way
redirect_from: /docs/withdrawal/
---

The Withdrawal Protocol is used to transfer bitcoins out of high-security
cold storage.

Before beginning, consider whether you want to route your funds through one or
more intermediary non-cold-storage addresses for privacy purposes. (Review the
Privacy Considerations subsection for details.) If you do, you may want to
withdraw the funds to an intermediary address *first* before sending them on to
their final destination.

In this first section, we'll gather physical hardcopies of all information
needed to do the withdrawal. This is done with the help of a regular networked
computer to find some of this information online and translate it into printed
QR codes.

On any Internet-connected computer:

1. If this is **not** your first time working with Glacier:
    1. Use a networked computer to access the latest full release of Glacier (
    not just the protocol document) at <https://github.com/GlacierProtocol/GlacierProtocol/releases>.
    2. Open the protocol document (Glacier.pdf) within the ZIP file.
    3. Check the Release Notes (Appendix E) of the protocol document to see if
    there are any new versions of Glacier recommended.
    4. Whether or not you decide to upgrade, review the errata for the version
    of Glacier you are using at <https://github.com/GlacierProtocol/GlacierProtocol/releases>.
2. Open your electronic copy of the
<span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Page</span>
(see Section II of the Deposit Protocol for details).
3. Identify the blockchain transactions associated with the funds you'd like
to withdraw.
    1. Go to [Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/), paste your
    <span class="warning">cold storage address</span> into the search bar,
    and press Enter.
    2. You'll be taken to a page that says "Bitcoin Address" at the top, with
    your <span class="warning">cold storage address</span> listed underneath.
    3. Click the "Unspent Outputs" link. The page will show a list of
    **<span class="warning">transaction IDs</span>**
    (in horizontal gray bars) and their corresponding **amounts** (in green boxes).
    Each <span class="warning">transaction ID</span> corresponds to a deposit
    you made, the remainder of a deposit you made after doing a partial
    withdrawal, or a deposit someone else made to your cold storage address.
    If you're taken to a page that says "No free outputs to spend", this
    indicates a zero balance at the address. Verify you pasted the address
    correctly.
    4. Identify a set of <span class="warning">transaction IDs</span> whose amounts are **cumulatively**
    greater than or equal to the amount you would like to withdraw.
    If a transaction ID is listed more than once (i.e. the same transaction
    has more than one unspent output going to your cold storage address), you
    just need to include the transaction ID once. GlacierScript will include
    all UTXOs in every supplied transaction ID.
    5. Copy-paste these <span class="warning">transaction IDs</span> to a temporary scratchpad for
    reference.
    6. These will be referred to as **<span class="warning">unspent transaction IDs</span>**.
4. Get raw data for blockchain transactions.
    1. For each <span class="warning">unspent transaction ID</span> from your
    temporary scratchpad:
        1. Go to the following URL, substituting the unspent transaction ID in
        the specified place:
           [https://blockchain.info/tx/<span class="primary">transaction-id-here</span>?format=hex](https://blockchain.info/tx/transaction-id-here?format=hex)

           Example page contents:
           <pre><code><span class="warning">01000000016847105309a8604c7e4f5773d0a16c45248acce057dab62e
           db0fedc2810d49a4010000006b48304502210093e6b4154d42c1bba27c
           548a80488673967be32c8de2f11e01a1402a5500e13302203e20874e5d
           0af516c902d3b600ee94571a7ce68a14a384dc05d4346e1009fe000121
           039fd6f25c87f183260c1d4a3a3ae33a2c06414db4c40d0c2ab76a7192
           1fef0939ffffffff01e0930400000000001976a914e770a7c13f977478
           3e80607f40be4547780315b688ac00000000</span></code></pre>

   2. This entire page be referred to as a
   **<span class="warning">raw unspent transaction</span>**.
   3. Copy-paste the <span class="warning">raw unspent transaction</span>
   next to the unspent <span class="warning">transaction ID</span> in
   your temporary scratchpad.
5. Create QR codes
    1. Find an online QR code generator, such as <http://goqr.me>.
    2. For each unspent <span class="warning">transaction ID</span> in your
    temporary scratchpad:
        1. Copy-paste the <span class="warning">raw unspent transaction</span>
        into the QR code generator.

            **NOTE:**  Some raw unspent transactions are too long to be converted
            into a single QR code -- or the QR code may be such high resolution
            that some QR code readers may struggle to read it.

            In these cases, you will need to split the data into multiple QR
            codes, and manually splice them back together on the quarantined
            computer after decoding each QR codes.

            **Make sure there is no extra
            whitespace (i.e. a space, or pressing "Enter") at the end of any
            copy-pastes! This can change the QR code.**

        2. Print out the resulting <span class="warning"> QR code</span>. (If
          printing from goqr.me, just print the first page.)
        3. Write "raw unspent transaction" somewhere on the printout.
    3. Repeat step (b) above for other needed information:
        1. Cold storage address (from the <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Page</span>)
        2. Redemption script (from the <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Page</span>)
        3. <span class="warning">Destination address</span> to which you will be withdrawing the funds
            1. **Carefully** transcribe the destination address by hand on the printed page with its QR code. (This will facilitate verification in the quarantined environment.)
            2. Double-check that the transcribed address is correct.
            3. If you are sending funds directly to another party with whom you do *not* have high trust, be mindful of the risk of transaction malleability fraud.
6. Gather other information.
    1. Make sure you have the necessary number of <span class="danger">Cold Storage Information Packets</span> on hand (you'll need the private keys).
        1. For the recommended 2-of-n multisignature withdrawal policy,
        you'll need any 2
        <span class="danger">Cold Storage Information Packets</span>.
        2. If you are performing an initial test withdrawal, you'll need *all*
        <span class="danger">Cold Storage Information packets</span>.
    2. Get transaction fee market data.

        The operators of the Bitcoin network require a (very small) fee for
        processing transactions. There is not a fixed fee schedule; if the fee
        is too low, the withdrawal will never get processed, and if the fee is
        too high, you unnecessarily waste money. This data will be used to
        calculate a reasonable fee for expedient transaction processing.

        1. Go to https://bitcoinfees.21.co/api/v1/fees/recommended

            Example page content:
            ```
            {"fastestFee":100,"halfHourFee":100,"hourFee":70}
            ```

        2. Note the number next to "fastestFee" -- in the above example, 100.
        This indicates that paying 100 satoshis/byte is sufficient to be among
        the transactions processed most quickly by the Bitcoin
        network.(1satoshi=10^-8 BTC,and a typical transaction is under 1000
        bytes).

            As of January 2017, the number 100 is typical. **If the number is
            radically different (*not* between 10 and 1000), stop; something may
            be wrong.** Seek assistance.

        3. Write that number down on a piece of paper labeled "Fee rate".
