  protocol for storing bitcoins in a highly secure way
---

In this section, we construct a "signed transaction" in our quarantined
environments, verify it, and then use QR codes to extract it from the
quarantined environments (for execution in the following section).

1. Execute [Section VI of the Setup Protocol](/docs/setup/quarantined-workspace/)
to prepare your quarantined workspace.
2. Construct the withdrawal transaction.

   **On the Q1 computer:**
    1. Import QR code data
        1. Start the QR code reader:

            ```
            $ zbarcam
            ```
            A window will appear with your laptop's video feed.

        2. For each QR code you printed out in Section I:
            1. Hold the QR code up to the webcam.
            2. When a green square appears around the QR code on the video
            feed, it has been successfully read.
            3. Verify the decoded QR code is shown in the terminal window.
                Example:
                <pre><code>QR-Code:<span class="warning" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">51410421167f7dac2a159bc3957e3498bb6a7c2f16874bf1fbbe5b523b3632d2c0c43f1b491f6f2f449ae45c9b0716329c0c2dbe09f3e5d4e9fb6843af083e222a70a441043704eafafd73f1c32fafe10837a69731b93c0179fa268fc325bdc08f3bb3056b002eac4fa58c520cc3f0041a097232afbe002037edd5ebdab2e493f18ef19e9052ae</span></code></pre>
            4. Copy-paste the decoded data (everything *after*, but not
            including, "QR-code:") into the Quarantined Scratchpad.
            5. Make a note of what the data is, based on your handwritten
            label from the printed QR code (i.e. "raw unspent transaction" or
            "redemption script").
    2. Close the window with the live video feed.
    3. Verify the destination address in the Quarantined Scratchpad matches
    your handwritten copy of the destination address.
    4. Transcribe the other information you will be using into the Quarantined
    Scratchpad. If you make a transcription error, it will be easier to
    identify and fix in the scratchpad compared to a situation where you
    transcribed it directly
    into GlacierScript.
        1. <span class="danger">Private keys</span>
        2. Fee rate

            Transcribe the private keys with reasonable care, but painstaking
            verification is not critical. (If you make an error, the
            withdrawal will simply fail, prompting you to fix your
            transcription error.)

    5. If any raw unspent transactions are too long, move each too-long
    transaction to its own file.

        GlacierScript normally takes input by copy-pasting values, but it can only accept copy-pasted values up to about 4000 characters in size.

        1. If any raw unspent transaction is longer than 4000 characters,
        you'll need to save it to its own file on disk.
            1. If you're not sure if it's 4000 characters, you can try the
            copy-paste method. If it's too long (or if there is some other
              problem with it), you'll receive a "TX decode" error (code 22).
        2. You can do this by opening a new TextEdit window, pasting the raw
        unspent transaction into it, and saving the file.
        3. Make sure to save it to the folder containing `glacierscript.py`.
    6. Begin construction of the withdrawal transaction:
        ```
        $ cd ~/glacier
        $ ./glacierscript.py create-withdrawal-data
        ```
    7. When prompted for the number of private keys to use:
        1. **<span style="color: red;">If you are doing an initial test withdrawal for a new cold
        storage address, choose *N*</span>** (i.e. the total number of keys in your
        multisignature withdrawal policy -- 4 if you use the default
        recommendation).
        2. Otherwise, select 2 (assuming you're using the recommended 2-of-n
        withdrawal policy).
    8. Enter all data as prompted by copy-pasting from the Quarantined
    Scratchpad.
        1. *Technical note for experienced Bitcoin users:* If the withdrawal
        amount & fee are cumulatively less than the total amount of the
        unspent transactions, the remainder will be sent back to the same cold
        storage address as change.
    9. The script will output a "raw signed transaction" and a *fingerprint* of the signed transaction for verification purposes.

        Example output:
        <pre><code>Sufficient private keys to execute transaction?
        True

        Raw signed transaction (hex): <span class="warning" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">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</span>

        QR code for transaction in transaction.png</code></pre>

3. Verify transaction construction
    1. **On the Q2 computer**, repeat step 2 above.
        1. Note: it is important to enter the <span class="danger">private keys</span> in the same
        order on each of the quarantined computers.
    2. Verify that the <span class="warning">"Transaction fingerprint"</span>
    output by GlacierScript is identical on both computers. It is possible for
    malware to exfiltrate bits of the private key in the transaction signature
    by choosing the nonce in a particular way. Bitcoin Core generates the
    nonce deterministically, as a function of a hash of the transaction, so we
    can detect the presence of any environment-specific malware by
    comparing the transaction generated in each quarantined environment.
    3. **If there are any discrepancies, do not proceed**. Restart the
    Withdrawal Protocol and seek assistance if discrepancies persist.
4. Visually hide all critically sensitive data.

    We'll be using a smartphone with a live Internet connection to read QR
    codes from the quarantined computer screens. Any malware (or a malicious
    QR reader app) could steal sensitive data if it is not visually hidden.

    **<span style="color: red;">This step is important. Failing to execute it properly creates a
    substantial security risk.</span>**

    1. Put your <span class="danger">Cold Storage Information Packets</span>
    out of sight -- this prevents a smartphone camera from accidentally seeing
    them.
    2. Delete all text from the Quarantined Scratchpad on the
    **Q1 and Q2** computers.
    3. **On the Q1 computer:**
        1. Copy-paste the <span class="warning">raw signed transaction</span>
        from the terminal window to the
        Quarantined Scratchpad.
        2. Enable line wrapping so the entire
        <span class="warning">raw signed transaction</span>
        can be seen.
            1. With the Quarantined Scratchpad window active, go to the menu
            bar at the top of the screen.
            2. Select Edit.
            3. Select Preferences.
            4. Select the View tab.
            5. Uncheck "Do not split words over two lines".
    4. Clear the terminal windows on the **Q1 and Q2** computers.
       ```
       $ clear
       ```
5. Extract the signed transaction from the quarantined environment.
    1. QR reader setup
        1. Remove a smartphone from the Faraday bag and turn it on.
        2. If the smartphone doesn't already have a QR code reader on it,
        install one.

           Any reader is fine as long as it can read all types of QR
        codes, but here are recommendations we've tested with this protocol:
        [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/qr-reader-for-iphone/id368494609?mt=8),
        [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.application_4u.qrcode.barcode.scanner.reader.flashlight&hl=en).
    2. Transfer the signed transaction data to a non-quarantined computer.
        1. **On the Q1 computer**, display the <span class="warning">raw
        signed transaction</span> as a QR code on the screen:
            1. In File Manager, navigate to the "Home" folder, then the
            "glacier" folder, and double-click "transaction.png".
        2. Use the smartphone's QR code reader to read the QR code. When the
        QR code is successfully read, the smartphone should display the
        <span class="warning"> raw signed transaction</span>.
        3. Verify the <span class="warning">raw signed transaction</span> on
        the smartphone matches the signed transaction data in the Quarantined
        Scratchpad.

           You only need to verify the first 16 characters, last 16
        characters, and a few somewhere in the middle.
        4. **If it does not match, do not proceed**. Try using a different QR
        reader application or restarting the Withdrawal Protocol. Seek
        assistance if discrepancies persist.
        5. Use the smartphone to send the
        <span class="warning">raw signed transaction</span> to yourself using
        a messaging app which you'll be able to access from a laptop.
6. Shut down **both** quarantined computers entirely. As a precaution against
side channel attacks, the quarantined computers should not be active except
when they absolutely need to be.
    ```
    $ sudo shutdown now
    ```
    The recommended Acer laptop may require you to hold down the power button
    for several seconds to complete the shutdown.
