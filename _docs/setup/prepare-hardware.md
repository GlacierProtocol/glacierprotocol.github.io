## Non-quarantined hardware

According to the specifications in the [Hardware required](/docs/before-you-start/hardware) section:

1. Label the two Setup Computers "SETUP 1" and "SETUP 2", using sticky notes
2. Label two USB drives "SETUP 1 BOOT" and "SETUP 2 BOOT", using a permanent marker
3. Run a virus scan on both Setup Computers. Options for virus scanning include:

    * **Windows**: [Kaspersky](https://usa.kaspersky.com/) ($39.99/yr),
    [Avira](https://www.avira.com) (Free)
    * **MacOS**: [BitDefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/) ($59.95/yr),
    [Sophos](https://home.sophos.com/) (Free)
    * **Linux**: Unnecessary

5. Take steps to remove any viruses found by the virus scanners

The Setup Computers are ready once the virus scan shows a clean system.

## Quarantined hardware

According to the specifications in the  [Hardware required](/docs/before-you-start/hardware) section,
paying *particular* attention to manfacturer requirements:

1. Separate your quarantined hardware into two parallel sets:

    * **Set 1**: "Q1" computer, "Q1 BOOT" USB drive, "Q1 APP" USB drive
    * **Set 2**: "Q2" computer, "Q2 BOOT" USB drive, "Q2 APP" USB drive

    The USBs labeled "Q1 BOOT" and "Q2 BOOT" will have the operating system to
    boot the corresponding computer.

    The USBs labeled "Q1 APP" and "Q2 APP" will have the software applications
    for use on the corresponding computer.

2. In each set, label all hardware with a permanent marker, writing directly on
the hardware.

    **Labeled hardware should <span style="color:red">only</span> be used with
    hardware within the same set**, for example:

    1. **Only** plug **"Q1 BOOT"** and **"Q1 APP"** USB drives into the **"Q1"** laptop
    2. **Only** plug **"Q2 BOOT"** and **"Q2 APP"** USB drives into the **"Q2"** laptop
    3. **Don't** plug an **unlabeled**, **"SETUP 1"** or **"SETUP 2"** USB drive into the **"Q1"** or **"Q2"** laptops

4. Quarantine "Q1" and "Q2" computers by removing the network and wireless interfaces:

    1. Unbox computers, but do **not** power on
    2. Place a tamper-resistant seal over the Ethernet port, if present
    3. Physically remove the wireless card:

        1. If using the recommended Dell laptop, follow [Dell's official instructions](https://topics-cdn.dell.com/pdf/inspiron-11-3162-laptop_Service%20Manual_en-us.pdf),
        or [Parts-People.Com, Inc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFYXQQPoh90)'s YouTube tutorial
        2. If using the recommended Acer laptop, the process is similar to the Dell, but note
        that there are two cover screws hidden underneath the rubber feet on the underside of the laptop

    4. After removing the wireless cards, cover the ends of the internal wi-fi antennae with electrical tape
    5. If not using the recommended laptops, and the computers have separate WiFi and Bluetooth cards,
    ensure both are removed. Most modern computers, including the recommended Acer and Dell,
    have a single wireless/bluetooth card.

5. Fully charge both computers, if relevant.
