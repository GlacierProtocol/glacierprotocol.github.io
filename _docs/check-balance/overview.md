The Viewing Protocol is a simple procedure for viewing your balance of funds
currently in one cold storage address.

1. Open your electronic copy of the
<span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Page</span> (see Section II
for details). If you've lost access to it, you'll need to recreate a new
electronic copy by transcribing one of the hardcopies (stored with each private
key) by hand.
2. Go to [Blockr](https://www.coinbase.com/) , paste your
<span class="warning">cold storage address</span> into the search bar, and
press Enter.
3. You'll be taken to a page that says "Bitcoin Address" at the top, with your
<span class="warning">cold storage address</span> listed underneath.
4. Your balance will be listed on the page.
