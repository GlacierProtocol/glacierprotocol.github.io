Glacier has been written and tested around these specific equipment recommendations.

## Factory new hardware

All items *must* be brand new and factory sealed. Manufacturers A and B *must* be
different, and manufacturers C and D *must* be different.

### Eternally quarantined

* **Q1**: Computer from manufacturer A, with two USB ports and a camera: For example,
[2016 Dell Inspiron 11.6"](http://a.co/1E6HEQA)
* **Q1 BOOT**: USB drive from manufacturer C, minimum 2GB: For example, [SanDisk Cruzer 8GB](http://a.co/1Us66ze)
* **Q1 APP**: USB drive from manufacturer C, minimum 2GB: For example, [SanDisk Cruzer 8GB](http://a.co/1Us66ze)

* **Q2**: Computer from manufacturer B, with two USB ports and a camera: For example,
[Acer Aspire One Cloudbook 11"](http://a.co/1ZMSB3Y)
* **Q2 BOOT**: USB drive from manufacturer D, minimum 2GB: For example, [Verbatim 2GB](http://a.co/jdzEf8O)
* **Q2 APP**: USB drive from manufacturer D, minimum 2GB: For example, [Verbatim 2GB](http://a.co/jdzEf8O)

The computers require two USB ports for simultaneous usage of the USB drives. Cameras are
required for reading QR codes.

### Non-quarantined

* **SETUP BOOT 1**: USB drive from manufacturer C, D or other (2GB+): For example, [Verbatim 2GB](http://a.co/jieluaE)
* **SETUP BOOT 2**: USB drive from manufacturer C, D or other (2GB+): For example, [Verbatim 2GB](http://a.co/jieluaE)

## Used/existing hardware

* **SETUP 1**: Computer, either brand new or has not spent much time connected to the internet,
with internet connectivity, administrator access, and 2GB of free disk space. *Must*
be running Windows 10, MacOS, or Linux. 
* **SETUP 2**: Computer with internet connectivity, administrator access, and about
2GB of free disk space. *Must* be running Windows 10, MacOS, or Linux.
* **Printer**
* **Smartphone**: Must have a working camera

### Other equipment

* **Precision screwdrivers**: To dismantle hardware. For example, [Tekton 2977](http://a.co/bbvj16a)
* **Electrical tape**: To insulate loose connection. For example, [Duck](http://a.co/gZZiEdA)
* **Casino-grade six-sided dice**: To provide entropy. Casino dice offer number generation which is closer to true randomness than a computer can provide.
The square corners, filled in pips and low manufacturing tolerances mean casino dice remove
any potential dice bias present in regular dice. For example, [Trademark Poker](http://a.co/ghbdiak)
* **Faraday bag**: To prevent smartphone data exfiltration via radio side channel. For example, [Stealth Anti Signal Forensic Faraday Bag](http://a.co/3wiNPLT)
* **Table fan**: To provide white noise. For example, [Holmes Lil' Blizzard](http://a.co/98PrpMs)
* **Home safe**: To secure keys, bolted to the floor. For example, [AmazonBasics Security Safe](http://a.co/6sRoaPv)
* **TerraSlate paper**: To write private keys on. For example, [TerraSlate paper](http://a.co/7pk5fJN)
* **Cardboard envelopes**: To opaquely store private keys. For example, [Quality Park Extra-Rigid Fiberboard](http://a.co/7jUPLMR)
* **Tamper-resistant seals**: To highlight tampering. For example, [BoxSilver Security Holograms](http://a.co/96KlsAl)
