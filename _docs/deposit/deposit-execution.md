  step-by-step protocol for storing bitcoins in a highly secure way

Depositing funds requires the Internet, and does not require handling any
critically sensitive cold storage data, so you can use any Internet-connected
computer for this section.

You will need access to an electronic and paper copy of your
<span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Page</span>.

1. Consider whether you want to route your funds through one or more
intermediary non-cold-storage addresses for privacy purposes. (Review the
Privacy Considerations subsection for details.)
    If you do, make those intermediate transfers using whatever means you
    normally use to transfer bitcoins.
2. If you are depositing a large amount, consider making a small deposit as a test followed by a second deposit for the remainder.
3. Verify cold storage address.
    1. Get one of the paper
    <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Pages</span> containing
    your cold storage address.
    2. Open your electronic copy of the
    <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Page</span>
    (see Section II for details).
    If you've lost access to it, you'll need to recreate a new electronic
    copy by transcribing one of the hardcopies (attached to each public key)
    by hand.
    3. Visually verify that the
    <span class="warning">cold storage addresses</span> are identical in the
    electronic copy and paper copy.
    This is to insure that the electronic copy was not damaged, hacked,
    accidentally changed due to a typo, etc.
    4. Return the paper
    <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Page</span> to its
    normal secure storage.
4. Perform the deposit.
    1. Use the wallet software or service of your choice to prepare to send the
    desired amount of funds to your
    <span class="warning">cold storage address</span>.
    The Bitcoin network requires a fee to process transactions. We recommend
    you use a wallet service that either covers the fees for you or recommends
    a fee amount automatically, which most do.

        Enter all necessary transaction information, but do not actually execute the transaction.

        1. Copy-paste your <span class="warning">cold storage address</span>
        from the <span class="warning">Cold Storage Information Page</span>
        into the wallet software.

    2. Double-check that the address you pasted matches the address in the Cold
    Storage Information Page.  If you use the wrong address, you will lose all
    of your funds with no recourse.
    3. Execute the transaction.
5. Verify the deposit on the public blockchain.
    1. Go to Blockr, paste the address into the search bar, and press Enter.
    You'll be taken to a page that says "Bitcoin Address" at the top, with your
    <span class="warning">cold storage address</span> listed underneath.
    2. Within a couple of minutes (and often much faster), you should be able
    to refresh this page and see your funds listed under "Unconfirmed".
    3. Periodically refresh the page until you see the funds moved from
    "Unconfirmed" to be reflected in "Balance". This generally happens within
    15 minutes; if the Bitcoin network is unusually congested, it may
    take longer.

Your funds are now secured in cold storage.

If this was your first deposit to this <span class="warning">cold storage
address</span>, proceed to the next section. Otherwise, you have completed the
Deposit Protocol.
